On page http://172.28.21.17/index.php?page=upload# we can upload a file.

We noticed that image in jpg, jpeg and png were present in the site.

We can imagine that we could upload another type of file in order to do intrude some command with file injection.

so we upload our file, and with Burp Suite, changed the "Content-Type: " to "image/jpeg". And we get the flag.
